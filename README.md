A machine learning model that accurately predicts household item prices for major e-commerce retailers, using a dataset of 1,000,000 transactions! 💸 Achieving an impressive 77% accuracy, this model empowers retailers to optimize pricing strategies, attract customers with competitive pricing, and adapt to the dynamic e-commerce landscape. 🚀

# Price Estimation Model for Household Items Using Machine Learning 🏠📈
## Overview 📊
This project presents a machine learning model developed to predict prices for household items sold by major e-commerce retailers. 💡
The model is based on analyzing over 1,000,000 transactions from e-commerce website datasets and uses various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms from the sci-kit-learn library. 🛠️

## Project Period 📅
August 2020 – August 2021 ⌛

# Motivation 🌟
Pricing is a critical aspect of selling products online, and accurately determining the right price can be challenging. 💼
The motivation behind this project was to develop a price prediction model that utilizes basic principles of machine learning to predict the accurate pricing of household items based on various parameters. 🎯

# Data and Preprocessing 📊🔄
The dataset used consists of 1,000,000 rows, and important features like category name, brand name, and item description were considered for prediction. 🗃️
Data preprocessing techniques, such as label encoding and data cleaning, were applied to handle missing values and transform textual data into a numerical format. 🛠️

# Prediction Algorithms 🧠🔮
Three predictive algorithms were implemented: Ridge Regression, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) Regression, and XGBoost Regression. 🤖
These algorithms were trained and tested to predict the average price of household items. 🎯💰

# Results and Observations 📈🔍
The models were evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) metrics. 📊
Advanced Text Preprocessing significantly improved the accuracy of all three models, with Ridge Regression showing the best performance. 📈

# Future Scope 🚀🔮
Future improvements can include integrating image classification to further enhance the accuracy of the model by considering product images. 📸🔍
Additionally, incorporating seller profile verification can be explored to refine the prediction model. 🛠️🤝

Let's predict prices with precision and unlock the power of data-driven pricing strategies! 💪💼
